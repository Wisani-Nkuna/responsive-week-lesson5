    <p>
      Two other popular braai side dishes, chakalaka and pap, are often enjoyed
      alongside mains just like boerewors. Chakalaka is a vegetable-based South
      African dish that combines beans, onions, peppers, carrots, and a unique
      blend of spices to create a punchy side that is great alongside meat. Itâ€™s
      also often served with pap, a corn meal side thatâ€™s similar to polenta.
      The spicy chakalaka and creamy pap make for a winning blend, and these are
      two South African dishes that should definitely be on your list to try.â€¯
